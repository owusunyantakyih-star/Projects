        <h1>REFLECTION ON ASSIGNMENT 2</h1><br><br>
        <p>
            This was a pretty big learning assignment for me to understand how HTML interacts with
            file structure for web development projects. In building the folder structure and
            linking to files and directories, I did not encounter too many big challenges. I tried
            to make sense of my file organization and tried to name my directories clearly and be user-friendly.
            Anytime there were problems caused by broken links or references, I would go back and double-check my
            referencing. More often than not, ensuring my links were correct entailed checking relative paths,
            and a lot of detail was paid to the matching of file names and extensions. This process taught me how
            important the attention to detail actually was in web development.
        </p>

        <p>
            One important thing learned from this assignment is the important role file structure plays in
            website creation in terms of responsiveness and organization. A well-thought-out logical file structure
            contributes to ease of development, maintainability, and scalability of the project. It really opened
            my eyes that such clear and logical file organization can make all the difference in user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            For me, the most challenging part of the assignment was trying to understand and apply the CSS box model.
            First, I had a hard time trying to understand how padding, borders, and margins interacted with each other
            and affected the positioning of elements on the page. In surmounting this challenge, I did quite a lot of
            research and experimented with different values and properties. I queried about the box model by referring
            to various online resources, tutorials, and documentation. And through trial and error, I was able to get a
            feeling for how to apply the box model to reach certain layouts and styles.
        </p>

        <p>
            In short, this assignment has been a learning process: in file structures, referencing, and the CSS box
            model. Working through the various challenges has equipped me with relevant skills and knowledge on how to
            handle similar tasks more effectively in the future.
